# Medium Problems - Notes

## General Strategies for Medium Problems

- **Dynamic Programming**: Break down problems into subproblems
- **Backtracking**: Explore all possible solutions with pruning
- **Graph Algorithms**: BFS, DFS, topological sort
- **Advanced Data Structures**: Use heaps, tries, union-find when appropriate
- **Two Pointers/Sliding Window**: More complex variations than easy problems

## Key Takeaways

- Medium problems often require combining multiple techniques
- Consider trade-offs between time and space complexity
- Look for patterns in similar problems
- Practice recognizing when to use specific data structures

## Common Patterns

1. **Dynamic Programming**: 
   - 1D DP (Fibonacci-like)
   - 2D DP (Grid problems, LCS)
   - State machine DP
   
2. **Graph Problems**:
   - BFS for shortest path
   - DFS for connectivity
   - Topological sort for dependencies

3. **Backtracking**:
   - Combinations/Permutations
   - Subset problems
   - Constraint satisfaction

4. **Tree Problems**:
   - Level-order traversal
   - Path sum variations
   - Serialization/Deserialization

5. **Greedy + Sorting**:
   - Interval problems
   - Meeting rooms
   - Task scheduling

## Tips

- Draw diagrams for complex problems
- Start with a brute force solution, then optimize
- Consider edge cases and constraints carefully
- Use meaningful variable names for clarity
- Comment your code to explain the approach

# Easy Problems - Notes

## General Strategies for Easy Problems

- **Array/String Problems**: Often use two pointers, sliding window, or hash maps
- **Linked List**: Focus on pointer manipulation and edge cases (empty list, single node)
- **Trees**: Usually involve simple traversal (inorder, preorder, postorder)
- **Math**: Look for patterns, use modulo operations, and consider edge cases

## Key Takeaways

- Always consider edge cases
- Start with brute force, then optimize
- Time complexity for easy problems is usually O(n) or O(n log n)
- Hash maps are your friend for O(1) lookups

## Common Patterns

1. **Two Pointers**: Used for sorted arrays or strings
2. **Hash Map**: For fast lookups and counting
3. **Sliding Window**: For subarray/substring problems
4. **Greedy**: Make locally optimal choices
5. **Binary Search**: For sorted arrays

## Tips

- Read the problem carefully
- Understand the constraints
- Think about edge cases before coding
- Test with simple examples first
